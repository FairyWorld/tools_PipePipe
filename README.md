# NewPipeEnhanced

An unofficial fork of [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) aiming to provide more services and more client features.

## New Client Features:

- One-click starting a shuffled playlist
- Click-to-play at playlist page

## Current Extra Services List:

- Bilibili

- Niconico

## Original Services List:

- Youtube
- SoundCloud
- media.ccc
- bandcamp
- Peertube

## Contribute

Any service not contain R-18G things, and any new features making user experience more comfortable are welcomed. Feel free to make your PR!

## Note

This repo exists because BiliBili service is rejected by the team due to censorship concerns. Please **DO NOT** raise any issue about merging to upstream in this repo, [TeamNewPipe/NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe), or [TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/). It is **MEANINGLESS** and a **WASTE OF TIME** for the maintainers.

This repo is **NOT** the orginal repo of Newpipe, and will **NOT** always keep up with the latest version of the original repo.

This repo can **NOT** ensure every extra service is available. If a service fails to work, it will stay failing until a kind (or maybe new) maintainer repairs
it.

## Special Thanks
