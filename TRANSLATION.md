Thanks for your interest in contributing to the translation!

We use AI to support translation in the following languages:
Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, French, German, Italian, Spanish

DO NOT modify \n, " and other "strange" symbols - they are used for formatting. Only change the text part, unless you know what you are doing!

If you want to modify a translation already supported by AI:
1. Find the translation file corresponding to your language, for example, Japanese is [app/src/main/res/values-ja/strings.xml](https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipeClient/blob/dev/app/src/main/res/values-ja/strings.xml).
2. Click "Fork and edit this file"
3. Make sure to only change the translation of problematic entries, keep other entries unchanged, and do not change the order of entries.
4. Save & make a pull request (will be done automatically)

If you want to modify a translation not supported by AI, please use `translator.py` for an initial translation and then polish it to ensure the correctness of the format and order. It is recommended to open an issue and contact me before deciding on the translation.
